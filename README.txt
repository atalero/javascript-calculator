Calculator that runs on JavaScript. I carefully programmed each button using jQuery in order to manipulate the stack of each operation. The technique I used for calculation involved postfix notation as a way of dealing with the order of operations. In order to manage floating points, decimals are rounded up to five decimal places. Note: CE removes the last operand or operator entered, AC eliminated the whole operation.
